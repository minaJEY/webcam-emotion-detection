One motivation for representation learning is that learning algorithms can design features better and faster than humans can. To this end, we hold this challenge that does not explicitly require that entries use representation learning. Rather, we introduce an entirely new dataset and invite competitors from all related communities to solve it. The dataset for this challenge is a facial expression classification dataset that we have assembled from the internet. Because this is a newly introduced dataset, this contest will see which methods are the easiest to get quickly working on new data.
